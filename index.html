            <h2 class="title-p">Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
            React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a
            basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel
            very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to
            check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide
            without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour,
            but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and
            JavaScript at the same time.Let’s Get Started!
        Keep scrolling down, and you’ll find the the next chapter of this documentation guide.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Introducing_JSX" class="main-section">
        <header>Introducing JSX</header>
        <p>Consider this variable declaration:
        <pre> <code>const element = &lth1>Hello, world!&lt/h1>;</code> </pre>
        This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

        It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using
        it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a
        template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

        JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in
        the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you
        started.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Why JSX?</h2>
        React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

        Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

        React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

        With that out of the way, let’s get started!
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2 class="title-p">Embedding Expressions in JSX</h2>
        In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it
        inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

        <pre> <code>
                const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = &lth1>Hello, {name}&lt/h1>;ReactDOM.render(
            element,document.getElementById('root'));
        </code> </pre>
        You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.

        In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an h1 element.

        <pre> <code>
      function formatName(user) {
            return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
                }

                const user = {
                  firstName: 'Harper',
                  lastName: 'Perez'
                };

                const element = (
                  &lth1>
                    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
                  &lt/h1>
                );

                ReactDOM.render(
                  element,
                  document.getElementById('root')
                );
        </code> </pre>
        We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to
        avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.

        </p>

        <p>
        <h2 class="title-p">JSX is an Expression Too</h2>
        After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

        This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

        <pre> <code>
            function getGreeting(user) {
                  if (user) {
                    return &lth1> Hello, {formatName(user)}!&lt/h1>;
                  }
                  return &lth1>Hello, Stranger.&lt/h1>;
}
        </code> </pre>

        </p>
        <h2 class="title-p">Specifying Attributes with JSX</h2>
        You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
        <pre>  <code>
            const element = &ltdiv tabIndex="0">&lt/div>;
        </code> </pre>
        You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:
        <pre> <code>
            const element = &ltimg src={user.avatarUrl}>&lt/img>;
        </code> </pre>
        Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces
        (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.

    <section id="Rendering_Elements" class="main-section">
        <header>Rendering Elements</header>
        <p>
            Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

            An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

            <pre> <code>
        const element = &lth1>Hello, world&lt/h1>;
    </code> </pre>
        Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
        React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>
        Let’s say there is a &ltdiv> somewhere in your HTML file:
        <pre> <code>
                &ltdiv id="root">&lt/div>
        </code> </pre>
        We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

        Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

        To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

        <pre> <code>
            const element = &lth1>Hello, world&lt/h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
        </code> </pre>
        It displays “Hello, world” on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Updating the Rendered Element</h2>
        React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

        With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

        Consider this ticking clock example:

        <pre> <code>
            function tick() {
  const element = (
    &ltdiv>
      &lth1>Hello, world!&lt/h1>
      &lth2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt/h2>
    &lt/div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}
setInterval(tick, 1000);
        </code> </pre>

        It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">React Only Updates What’s Necessary</h2>

        React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

        You can verify by inspecting the last example with the browser tools:

        <img src="https://reactjs.org/granular-dom-updates-c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224.gif" alt="">
        Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents has changed gets updated by React DOM.

        In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment rather than how to change it over time eliminates a whole class of bugs.

        </p>


    </section>

    <section id="Components_and_Props" class="main-section">
        <header>Components and Props</header>
        <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.

            Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Function and Class Components</h2>
        The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
        <pre> <code>
            function Welcome(props) {
  return &lth1>Hello, {props.name}&lt/h1>;
}
        </code> </pre>
        This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

        You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:
        <pre> <code>
           class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lth1>Hello, {this.props.name}&lt/h1>;
  }
}</code> </pre>
        The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

        Classes have some additional features that we will discuss in the next sections.
        Until then, we will use function components for their conciseness.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Rendering a Component</h2>
        Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
        <pre> <code>const element = &ltdiv />;
        </code> </pre>
        However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
        <pre> <code>
            const element = &ltWelcome name="Brajan" />;
        </code> </pre>
        When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

        For example, this code renders “Hello, Brajan” on the page:
        <pre> <code>
           function Welcome(props) {
  return &lth1>Hello, {props.name}&lt/h1>;
}

const element = &ltWelcome name="Brajan" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
        </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Let’s recap what happens in this example:</h2>

        <pre> <code>
            We call ReactDOM.render() with the &ltWelcome name="Brajan" /> element.
React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Brajan'} as the props.
Our Welcome component returns a &lth1>Hello, Brajan&lt/h1> element as the result.
React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match &lth1>Hello, Brajan&lt/h1>.
        </code> </pre>

    <section id="State_and_Lifecycle" class="main-section">
        <header>State and Lifecycle</header>
        <p>
            This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a detailed component API reference here.

            Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:
            <pre> <code>
                function tick() {
  const element = (
    &ltdiv>
      &lth1>Hello, world!&lt/h1>
      &lth2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt/h2>
    &lt/div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
    </code> </pre>
        In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.

        We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:
        <pre> <code>
            function Clock(props) {
  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &lth1>Hello, world!&lt/h1>
      &lth2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt/h2>
    &lt/div>
  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    &ltClock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
        </code></pre>
        However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.

        Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:

        <pre>  <code>
            ReactDOM.render(
  &ltClock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
        </code></pre>
        To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.

        State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

        We mentioned before that components defined as classes have some additional features.
        Local state is exactly that: a feature available only to classes.

        </p>

        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Converting a Function to a Class    </h2>
        You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.</li>
            <li>Add a single empty method to it called render().</li>
            <li>Move the body of the function into the render() method.</li>
            <li>Replace props with this.props in the render() body.</li>
            <li>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre> <code>
            class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &ltdiv>
        &lth1>Hello, world!&lt/h1>
        &lth2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt/h2>
      &lt/div>
    );
  }
}
        </code> </pre>
        Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.

        The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render <Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used.
        This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

    <section id="Handling_Events" class="main-section">
        <header>Handling Events</header>
        <p>
            Handling events with React elements is very similar
            to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic differences:
            <ul>
        <li>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
        </li>
        <li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
        For example, the HTML:
    </ul>
        <pre>  <code>
            &ltbutton onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
&lt/button>
        </code> </pre>
        is slightly different in React:
<pre><code>
    &ltbutton onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
&lt/button>
</code></pre>
        Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML
        , to prevent the default link behavior of opening a new page, you can write:
        <pre><code>
            &lta href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false">
  Click me
&lt/a>
        </code></pre>
        In React, this could instead be:
        <pre><code>
            function ActionLink() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    &lta href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    &lt/a>
  );
}
        </code></pre>
        Here, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. See the SyntheticEvent reference guide to learn more.

        When using React you should generally not need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

        When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states:
        <pre><code>
            class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      isToggleOn: !state.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &ltbutton onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      &lt/button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &ltToggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
        </code></pre>

        You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

        This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.

        If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

        <pre><code>
            class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &ltbutton onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      &lt/button>
    );
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App.

        If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

<pre><code>
    class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      &ltbutton onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>
        Click me
    &lt/button>
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
        The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the
        constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

        </p>


        <p>
            <h2 class="title-p">Passing Arguments to Event Handlers</h2>
        Inside a loop it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler.
        For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:
        <pre><code>
            &ltbutton onClick={(e)=> this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row&lt/button>
            &ltbutton onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this,id)}>Delete Row&lt/button>
        </code></pre>
        The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively.

        In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.

        </p>
